	<h3 class = "break"> What is a "Break" </h3>
		<p class = "break">A break is a very view-sensitive hold. So basically, you are keeping track of where a card is located in the deck, and to do
		that, you have your pinky there. Be careful doing this because it is highly sensitive to a spectators view! This is the most common and easiest
		type of slight of hand. The best way to practice this is to stand in front of a miror and keep doing it in different places in the deck. Start
		of by placing ur "pinky" finger at the top of the deck, then slowly making your way to the bottom. This will help you to keep the break in
		different densities of the deck.</p>

	<h3 class = "cut"> The false cut </h3>
		<p class = "one"> Secondly, we have the false cut. The spectators believe you are mixing up the cards but in reality, they stay the exact same.
		This move is a little bit more advanced so don't feel discouraged if you dont get it on the first try. </p>

	<h3 class = "shuffle">The Fasle Shuffle </h3>
		<p class = "two"> The false shuffle is when you mix the cards partially, but retract and put pile "A" but on top of pile "B". The best way to
		practice this is by constantly doing it while looking, then blindfold yourself or just don't look at the deck. This will help you in your
		performance because you will need to maintain eye contact with your audience.</p>
	<h3 class = "under">The Undercut </h3>
		<p class = "three"> The undercut is when you controll a card from the middle of the deck, or even from the top, to the bottom of the deck. This
		is the one control that involves another type of slight of hand too, which is the thumb break (same thing as the pinky break but
		you keep a space in the cards with your thumb instead of your pinky).
	<h3 class = "double"> The double lift</h3>
		<p class = "four"> The double lift is very common and easy, but flashy. The double lift is mainly used when the spectator's card is at the very top
		but you need to convince them that it isn't. What you will do is pick two cards off the top of the deck, but making it look like you only have one
		card in your hand. That way, the spectator will think their card is in the middle of the deck because you can show that their chosen card isn't at the
		bottom either. This double lift is like a trick on its own, for the simple reason of it being really decieving to a spectators eye. The way to do
		this trick is to grab the deck in mechanics grip(see the photo below), and riffle your way up the cards, then stoping at two cards from the top. The
		way to do this is shown and explained, in detail, in this video below:
