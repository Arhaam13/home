		<h3 class = "mag"> Magician vs Gambler </h3>
		<p class = "wagwan">A very powerful and satisfying trick! As you saw in Hester23BearsCh's video, the undercut and double lifts show up many
		times throughout the trick.</p>
		<h5 class = "here">Here is the basic story line of the trick:</h5>
		<p class = "there">A magician and a gambler meet up at a bar, and they start to argue who is better at handling cards. Since a gambler was involved, a
		gamble occured. The magician bet the gambler $1M that he would deal out a one-of-a-kind pile(all 1s, 2s, etc). So the magician pull 1M out of his pocket,
		and so did the gambler... The magician started dealing the cards and they were all kings, until the last one. The last on was an ace, so at this point, 
		the gambler thinks he has won the bet. The magician reminds the gambler that he is a magician, and that all the cards they thought were kings turned out
		to be aces. That's the story of the Magician vs Gambler.</p>
