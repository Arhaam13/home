		<p class = "yeehaw"> Almost all cardists bring out their own decks of cards, which means there are so many choices to choose from, and we
		will help you cut down on which you want to use. Here are the top 14 decks of all time (quality- wise for magic purposes):</p>
  	
 	   <h3 class = "id">Poker 808 Bicycle Cards</h3>
		<p>This first choice may seem incredibly obvious, but Bicycle does have some of the most high-quality, decent cards on
		the market. These Poker 808 playing cards are the standard choice from Bicycle that you would see most often in red and
		blue.They are a tested and loved the pack, with customers raving about how incredibly durable they are even though they
		are thin and easy to shuffle. The cards have a glossy finish on them, making them stronger and less resistant to stains
		from liquids. On top of that, they are said to take quite a while to lose their snap – customers had mentioned in online
		reviews that they got over 90-100 hours before it was lost. These playing cards are also very affordable. You can buy a
		two-pack combo (comes with both a red and blue deck) on Amazon for only $8+ tax!</p>
	   <h4>Pros</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>High-quality</li>
				<li>Durability</li>
				<li>Affordable</li>
			</ol>
		<h4>Cons</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Old-fashion design</li>
			</ol>

	   <h3 class = "id">Swe deck</h3>
		<p>Next up, we have the SWE deck. To give you a little background about this deck of playing cards, they are named after
			the author S.W. Erdnase – he published The Expert at the Card Table in the year 1902. This book told the world
			how magicians were able to pull off their sleight of hand and is now a staple for anyone in the magic community.
			These cards have the entire cover of the book on the back of them. The cards are a rich and vibrant green and
			gold, and very easy to read. They are also a fantastic conversation starter when using them around other people.
